## How to Contribute

### Issues

If you encounter any issues, have questions, or need clarification, please open an issue on our [Issues page](https://github.com/your-repo/issues). This helps us track and prioritize bug fixes and enhancements.

### Branches

We have three main branches in this project:

- **master**: Contains the latest code. It is generally stable, but we recommend using it with caution.
- **a.b**: Use this branch for creating PRs. The naming convention follows `a.b`, where `a` is the major release and `b` is the minor release of the current version. For example, if the current release is 4.9.2, use the branch `4.9` for your PR. You can also use `4.9.x-dev` in your composer for development purposes.
- **future release**: This branch is typically `(a+1).0`. For instance, if the current release is 4.9.2, the future release branch will be `5.0`.


### Code Style and Guidelines

- **Follow PSR Standards**: We follow [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), and [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).
- **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
- **Documentation**: Update the documentation for any new features or changes.

### Common Practices

- **Keep Pull Requests Small**: Smaller PRs are easier to review and merge. Focus on one feature or fix per PR.
- **Write Tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by tests. We aim for a high level of test coverage.
- **Respect Reviewers' Time**: Be responsive to feedback and willing to make necessary changes.

### Community

- **Be Respectful**.
- **Collaborate**: We encourage collaboration and open discussion. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask for help or provide feedback.
